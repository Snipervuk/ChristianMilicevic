			 <h3>18 August 2020: IGB400 - An idea is born...</h3>
 			 <p>During school, I didn’t really know what I wanted to do for a career or what I was
				super passionate about. My family moved around a lot when I was younger, so I met a
				wide variety of people and experienced living in different environments. At some
				stage, like many kids, I was introduced to computers and video games. I found
				gaming engaging, as I love to be challenged and learn new things. I also like to delve
				into how stuff works and why it has been specifically designed a particular way,
				especially when it comes to technology. I believe tech is probably the most dynamic
				tool we have in our modern world. I love to create things that can benefit, inspire, or
				make a positive impact on others. When it came time to leave school, I decided that I
				wanted to study gaming, its applications and developments, and the wider field of
				computer science.
			 </p>
			 
			 <p>
			 It has to be said that the programming (and the software industry, generally) is a
			global phenomenon. It’s hugely competitive - some would even say cutthroat - unless
			you’re the likes of Bill Gates (and even he had to work hard to get to where he is).
			While having a genius IQ might help, the truth is that anyone in this industry is going
			to have to put in the hard yards if they plan to have a fulfilling career, particularly in
			the programming stream. To avoid feeling like you’ve been picked up and thrown in
			the deep end of the pool, I think it’s important to stay abreast of developing
			technologies and to continue to educate yourself beyond what you learn in your
			academic studies. I’m looking forward to learning on the job and challenging myself
			to always do better. But how many others are thinking like me? Recently, I decided I
			wanted to know how many professional programmers there are in the world, so I had
			a quick google and you can see the result below: 
			 </p>
			 
			 <img src="assets/css/images/Population.PNG"> <!--image source is non case sensitive/No Illegal characters like C# (The #)-->
			 

			 <p>
			 According to (Daxx, 2019), the global number of professional programmers
			(developers) in 2019 had nearly reached the same number as the entire population of
			my home country, Australia, i.e. 25 million people. That’s a lot of competitors in one
			race! Of course, not everyone has the same ambitions and interests, which is a good
			thing when you’re looking for a career in this field, but I do think there are some key
			skills all programmers need to have:
			 </p>
			 
			 <li> 
			 <p> &nbsp; An aptitude for problem-solving</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> &nbsp; Motivation for self-learning</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> &nbsp; Patience – it’s rarely going to go right the first time!</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> &nbsp; Research skills and knowledge retention</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> &nbsp; Organisational skills - until some brainiac works out how to bend time, we all get
						the same 24 hours in a day, so you want the ability to make every one of those
						hours count
			</p>
			 </li>
 			 <br></br> <!--Line Break*-->
			 
			 
			 
			 
			 <p>Speaking of time, there will be many times when you’ll want to hit your head against
				the keyboard and question your intelligence level. But it’s good to remember that
				you’re taking a bunch of 0s and 1s and making them do the most awe-inspiring things
				your grandparents couldn’t even dream of, so hang in there!
			 </p>
			 
			 <p>People who have inspired me, to date, are the following “Big 4”:</p>
			 
			 <li>
			 <p>&nbsp; Bill Gates</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p>&nbsp; Steve Jobs</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p>&nbsp; Mark Zuckerberg</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p>&nbsp; Gabe Newell</p>
			 </li>
			 <p>These are the people who took their hard work and made it something exceptional,
				even after dropping out of college/university.</p>
 			 <br></br> <!--Line Break*-->

			 
			 
			 <p>So now it comes down to what skills I would like to work on in my project for
				IGB400. After some thought, I’ve chosen the following:</p>
			 <li>
			 <p> Maths skills</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
 			 <p> Programming ability</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> Networking skills</p>
			 </li>

			 <p>Now here’s a confession…I personally don’t like maths, even though I’ve learnt
				matrices, vectors, trigonometry and coordinates in my university degree. It’s just one
				of those unsexy subjects I’ve hated since early school days. So, what’s the best way to
				tackle this aversion? Head on and no playing chicken! I’m using some vector3’s,
				basic rotations and coordinates to bury this vendetta once and for all.</p>
             
			 
			 <p>And what about those networking skills? I think that anyone who plans on becoming a
				programmer should have basic networking knowledge – and the employers seem to
				agree because it’s often a requirement in job listings, as you can see below:</p>
   			 
			 <img src="assets/css/images/Wargaming.PNG"> <!--image source is non case sensitive/No Illegal characters like C# (The #)-->
 			 <br></br> <!--Line Break*-->

			 <p>I’m aiming to develop a better understanding of networking and how it will contribute
				to my portfolio. By doing a programming project for IGB400, I’m also flexing the
				skills I mentioned above and I’ll be pushing myself to work them harder and develop
				them to be even better.</p>
			 
			 <p>So now I know what skills I want to use and develop, it’s time to think about the type
				of project I want to do for IGB400. I’ve come to the conclusion it will be something
				within the shooting genre. I’ve always enjoyed shooting games (though I’m not big on
				blowing up things in the real world) and I figure this will help with the motivation to
				get through the tough stuff. Also, shooting games are extremely popular in the video
				game industry and there are many different types such as:</p>
			 
			 
			 <li>
			 <p> First Person Shooters (FPS)</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> Third Person Shooters</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> Top Down Shooters</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> Arena Shooters</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> Top Down Shooters, etc</p>
			 </li>
			 <br></br> <!--Line Break*-->


			 <p>Narrowing down my choices, I also need to decide on what types of shooter I’m going
				to do and what mechanics I’m going to incorporate into it – this is the fun stuff! I’ve
				done some basic research in the following, hugely popular franchises:</p>
			 <p></p>
			 
			 <li>
			 <p> Call of duty</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> Battlefield</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> Halo</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> Killing Floor</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> CounterStrike</p>
			 </li>
 			 <br></br> <!--Line Break*-->

			 
			 <p>I know I’ll need skills in the following to achieve my end product:</p>
			 <li>
			 <p> Unity</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> C#</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> Some basic maths</p>
			 </li>
   			 
			 <br></br>
			 <p>Some examples of what an aim trainer might look like can be seen below:</p>
   			 <p><b>MW2 and  CSGO:</b></p>
			 <img src="assets/css/images/MW2.png"> <!--image source is non case sensitive/No Illegal characters like C# (The #)-->
 			 <img src="assets/css/images/CSGO.png"> <!--image source is non case sensitive/No Illegal characters like C# (The #)-->
  			 <img src="assets/css/images/CSGO2.png"> <!--image source is non case sensitive/No Illegal characters like C# (The #)-->
   			 <br></br> <!--Line Break*-->
			 
 			 <p>I’m looking at a basic level build using Unity’s ProBuilder and most likely stationary
				movement for the player to aim at targets. The aimbot will be togglable with a button
				that can be turned on and off. The aimbot will snap to the head (if the target is a
				humanoid). To implement this will depend on the target type (most likely it will just
				be based on the target’s transform.position).</p>
			 
			 <p>If I can get that all working correctly with the aimbot, I would also like to create a
				separate scene (in the same Unity file) that has a third person controller using some
				basic networking for multiplayer.</p>
			 
			 <p>To do this will need the following skills:</p>
			 <li>
			 <p> Unity</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> Probuilder for the level</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> Networking using Photon</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
			 <p> C#</p>
			 </li>
  			 <br></br> <!--Line Break*-->

			 
			 <p>An example of the third person controller can be seen below:</p>
			 <img src="assets/css/images/Thirdperson.png"> <!--image source is non case sensitive/No Illegal characters like C# (The #)-->
			 
			 <p>The third person multiplayer scene will only use capsules (saving time for animations
				and blending etc) and a basic third person shooting gun as previously shown.</p>
			 
			 <p>The second part of the project is a bit of an aspirational goal, I’ll admit. If I can pull it
				off that would be ideal, so no harm in aiming high! The main two concepts that will
				be the hardest things to tackle for this project will be:</p>
			 
			 <li>
			 <p> Learning how to use networking with the Proton engine</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
 			 <p>Mathematical concepts in code</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
 			 <p>Having time to test and bugfix to the multiplayer and aim trainer</p>
			 </li>
			 
			 <p>Being able to achieve both levels would demonstrate a decent understanding of game
				theory, mathematics, coding ability and game perspective types.</p>
			 
			 <p>An example of the perspective types that will be demonstrated can be seen below:</p>
			 
			 <p><b>First Person:</b></p>
			 <img src="assets/css/images/Arma1.png"> <!--image source is non case sensitive/No Illegal characters like C# (The #)-->
			 <p><b>Third Person:</b></p>
 			 <img src="assets/css/images/Arma2.png"> <!--image source is non case sensitive/No Illegal characters like C# (The #)-->
			 <br></br> <!--Line Break*-->
