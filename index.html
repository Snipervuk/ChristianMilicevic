											<h3>Technical Test 2</h3>
											<p>This project was done as a technical test for a job I applied for and was done using the Unity engine and C#. The test was to get an object to rotate 22.5 degrees on the y axis and to export PNG files to a specfic folder. Even though I didn't get the job, I still was able to make it to the final round of the interview and gained some good coding feedback from the interviewer.</p>

											<h3>IGB104</h3>
											<p>The very first unit I ever took at QUT, we learned how to program using Python with turtle and some web development.</p>

											<h3>IGB100</h3>
											<p>So for the very first game creation unit, as a team with two others (a business student and another software tech). We created our very first game together which was "Look, no hands!" using Unity and C#. It was based on a bike that goes downhill and picks up speed while the player has to dodge objects. The objects would RNG (random number generator) each time the game would play from a raycast; it was a simple game and was a good start.</p>
											<p>Our second game we created together was "Wobble". It was based on the concept of a game show that one of my team mates came up with. The user had to balance on a platform and throw objects to match the shape and colour for additional points. For a simple game with simple models, I found this project quite enjoyable and the result was satisfying.</p>

											<h3>IGB400</h3>
											<p>In this unit we had to create a portfolio and also make a project that would help contriubte to it. I chose to create this website to demonstrate my work to potential employers. Using previous knowledge of HTML, CSS and GitHub Pages I was able to create this website, while also learning and picking up new skills. This website will be something I intend to continue to develop, as I progress my programming career.</p>
											<p>The project I chose to create was multiplayer FPS shooter using networking (Photon Pun2) and C# in Unity with a toggleable aimbot.</p>
											<p>I really wanted to push myself to get a good outcome and even though I was told by many people that I might have overscoped this project, I continued to progress it. As of 4 November 2020, when I completed the project, the documentation of PhotonPun2 was still rapidly evolving since it was new and a lot of the documentation became out of date. This meant completing the project was challenging. I also learnt that debugging networking code is very difficult, especially with using RPC's (Remote procedure call).</p>
											<p>Overall, however, it was a really fun project, even more so because it was challenging. As you can see below there is a video of me testing it with eight other people. I haven't yet published it on WebGl as I still have a couple of bugs to iron out. Time is my latest and greatest challenege!</p>

											<h3>IGB283</h3>
											<p>This unit was about game engine theory; it taught us how to render objects with vertices, matrices, coordinates, vectors and calculus. The assignments were grouped and the unit involved advanced high school Math with programming.</p>

											<h3>IGB320</h3>
											<p>In this unit we were taught how to solve real world problems using gamified technology. Myself and two others came up with the concept of "Savvy Saver", which was an app that rewarded players for doing tasks in real life and rewarded them with credits. These credits could be spent on rewards that the player could choose from; our prototype was built using Adobe XD.</p>

											<h3>CAB201</h3>
											<p>In this unit we learned the basics of C# programming and how to code in visual studios. The assignment was paired programming with another computer science major and we created a board game similar to snakes and ladders.</p>

											<h3>CAB301</h3>
											<p>This unit was about learning algorithms and their time complexity. It also taught us the efficiency of algorithms and how to sort them. The assignment was based around sorting a movie database and searching with a binary tree while utilising a chosen sorting algorithm.</p>

											<h3>IGB383</h3>
											<p>This unit taught us about AI and their behaviors. It included the following concepts: behavior trees, boids and the Greedy & A* path finding algorithms.</p>
											<p>A video demo of the first assignment, which incorpated Greedy and the A* algorithm, can be seen below (video does lag a little due to StackOverflow exception error something I will fix when I get time):</p>
											<p>A video demo of the second assignment which had boids, can be seen below:</p>

											<p>On our last assignment our unit coordiantor made a bot tournament and we submitted a custom bot Behaviour tree using PandaBT and C# in Unity. The tournament style was a knockout style, free-for-all death match.</p>
											<p>A video can be seen below of my robot in the tournament at the following timestamps: <u>19:50-24:50</u>: and <u>31:51-35:51</u></p>

								<h2>My Story</h2>
							</header>							
							<p>Hi, my name is Christian Milicevic. I’m 21 years old, living in Brisbane, Australia, and I’m an IT alumnus of the Queensland University of Technology. I was born in Sydney but raised in south-east Queensland. One half of my family arrived in Australia in the 1960s from Serbia, with my grandfather working long, hard hours on the original Snow Mountains scheme; the other half have been here since the First Fleet arrived from England (and, yes, one of them came to Australia doing long, hard hours in leg irons). I come from a family of hard workers and I’ve inherited a strong work ethic, as shown in my resume. I take pride in doing a job properly, efficiently and with integrity. I have a passion for problem solving and finding out how stuff works, particularly as it relates to technology and automation. I enjoy being part of a team and expanding my experience by learning new concepts, skills and incorporating feedback from others. I hope to remain in south-east Queensland and to launch a career in a computer science-related position. While my bachelor degree major is in Software Technologies, I have no plan to limit myself – I’m keen to make the most of the diverse paths a career in programming can lead to. Please take the time to look at my portfolio and resume, and feel free to contact me at any time using the links below. Thanks for reading my website!</p>
