									<h3>IFB104</h3>
									<p>The very first unit I ever took at QUT university, we learned how to program using Python (yuck) with Turtle and some basic web development.</p>

									<h3>IGB100</h3>
									<p>So for the very first game creation unit, as a team with 2 others (a business student and another software tech). We created our very first game together which was "Look No hands" using Unity and C#. It was based on a bike that goes down hill and picks up speed and the player has to dodge objects. The objects would RNG each time the game would play from a raycast, it was a simple game and was ok...</p>
									<p>Our second game we created together was "Wobble", it was based off a game show that my team mate Cameron came up with. The user had to balance on a platform and throw objects to match the shape and colour for additional points. For a simple game with simple models, I found this project quite enjoyable and the result was alright</p>

									<h3>IGB283</h3>
									<p>IGB283 was about game engine theory, it taught us how to render objects with vertex's and about matrices, coordinates and vectors. The assignments were grouped and the unit in general was basically high school Math B and C stuff with programming.</p>

									<h3>IGB320</h3>
									<p>In this unit we were taught how to gamify real world problems into a fun like way. So myself and two others came up with the concept of "Savvy Saver", which was an app that rewarded players by doing tasks IRL and rewarded them with credits. These credits could be spent on rewards that the player can choose from, our prototype was built using Adobe XD.</p>

									<h3>IGB300</h3>
									<p>This was the first unit of Capstone, we made a premade team before the unit started so we knew who did what and what people can and couldn't do. Our team is made of 2x Programmers Majors, 4x Game Designers Majors and 1x Animator Major. We decided to not go with a stakeholder as it gave us free choice and less restricitons for our capstone project, you can see below the progress we made over the unit. Obviously we have a lot more still to do in IGB301, our next capstone unit.</p>

									<h3>CAB201</h3>
									<p>In this unit we learned the basics of C# programming, the unit consist of a lot of time and pain to an extend. The assignment was grouped with person, who was a mate of mine that did Computer Science degree</p>

									<h3>CAB301</h3>									
									<p>301 was about learning about algorithms and complexity, this unit was also a bit of a pain to wrap your head around (at least imo). But it taught us the basics of binary tree's and some sorting algorithms with programming</p>
