									<h3>IFB104</h3>
									<p>The very first unit I ever took at QUT university, we learned how to program using Python with turtle and some basic web development.</p>

									<h3>IGB100</h3>
									<p>So for the very first game creation unit, as a team with 2 others (a business student and another software tech). We created our very first game together which was "Look No hands" using Unity and C#. It was based on a bike that goes down hill and picks up speed and the player has to dodge objects. The objects would RNG each time the game would play from a raycast, it was a simple game and was ok...</p>
									<p>Our second game we created together was "Wobble", it was based off a game show that my team mate Cameron came up with. The user had to balance on a platform and throw objects to match the shape and colour for additional points. For a simple game with simple models, I found this project quite enjoyable and the result was alright</p>

									<h3>IGB283</h3>
									<p>IGB283 was about game engine theory, it taught us how to render objects with vertex's and about matrices, coordinates and vectors. The assignments were grouped and the unit in general was basically high school Math B and C stuff with programming.</p>

									<h3>IGB320</h3>
									<p>In this unit we were taught how to gamify real world problems into a fun like way. So myself and two others came up with the concept of "Savvy Saver", which was an app that rewarded players by doing tasks IRL and rewarded them with credits. These credits could be spent on rewards that the player can choose from, our prototype was built using Adobe XD.</p>

									<h3>IGB300</h3>
									<p>This was the first unit of Capstone, we made a premade team before the unit started so we knew who did what and what people can and couldn't do. Our team is made of 2x Programmers Majors, 4x Game Designers Majors and 1x Animator Major. We decided to not go with a stakeholder as it gave us free choice and less restricitons for our capstone project, you can see below the progress we made over the unit. Obviously we still had a lot more workto do in IGB301, our next capstone unit.</p>

									<h3>IGB383</h3>
									<p>This unit taught us about AI and their behaviors, this included the following such as: behavior trees, boids and the Greedy & A* path finding algorithms.</p>
									
									<p>A video demo of the first assignment which incorpated Greedy and the A* algorithm, can be seen below (video does lag a little due to StackOverflow exception errors something I have to fix eventually):</p>

									<p>On our last assignment our unit coordiantor made a bot tournament where we submitted a custom bot Behaviour tree using <b>PandaBT</b> and C# in Unity and the idea class had a round based robot team death match.</p>
									<p>A video can be seen below of my robot in the tournament at the following timestamps: <b>19:50-24:50</b> and <b>31:51-35:51</b></p>

									<h3>IGB301</h3>
									<p>This unit was a continuation of our team's IGB300 project which finally came to an end after 28 weeks of development in 2020.</p>

									<h3>IGB400</h3>
									<p>In this unit we had to create a portfolio and also make a project that would help contriubte to it. I choose to create this website to use to show my work to potential employers. Using previous knowledge of <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>GitHub Pages</b> I was able to create this website, while also learning and picking up new skills as well. This website will be something I will continue to add to, as I proceed in my programming carrer</p>
									<p>The project I choose to create was multiplayer FPS shooter using <b>networking (Photon Pun2)</b> and <b>C#</b> in Unity with also a toggleable aimbot.</p>
	
									<p>I really wanted to push myself to get a somewhat decent result and even though I was told by many people that I may of overscoped this project, I continued to proceed with the project anyway. As of 4/11/2020 when I did complete the project, the documentation of PhotonPun2 was changing heaps since it was new and a lot of the documentation was also out of date. So completing this project overall was quite challenging, another thing I learnt was that debugging networking bugs was also very difficult especially with using <b>RPC's</b>.</p>
									
									<p>But overall it was a very fun project, even though it was quite challenging. As you can see below there is a video of me testing it with 8 other people, I didn't get to publish yet on <b>WebGl</b> as I still have a couple of bugs to iron out and then I plan to release it when it is ready.</p>

									<h3>CAB201</h3>
									<p>In this unit we learned the basics of C# programming and how to code in visual studios. The assignment was paired programming with another computer science major</p>

									<h3>CAB301</h3>									
									<p>301 was about learning about algorithms and complexity, it also taught us the efficiency of algorithms and how to sort them as well. The assignment was based off sorting a movie database and searching with a binary tree and sorting with a chosen sorting algorithm</p>
